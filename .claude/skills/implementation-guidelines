# Implementation Guidelines

When implementing development tasks or requirements, follow these guidelines to ensure high-quality, maintainable code:

## Core Principles

### 1. Fulfill Requirements
- Carefully read and understand the full requirement specification
- Address all aspects mentioned in the description and reasoning
- Ensure the solution solves the stated problem completely
- Don't add unnecessary features beyond the scope

### 2. Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and well-organized code
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Maintain or improve existing code quality standards

### 3. Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Add integration tests where appropriate
- Manual testing should verify the user-facing behavior

### 4. Project Conventions
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the project
- Use the same libraries and frameworks already in use
- Respect the project's architectural decisions
- Match the naming conventions used throughout the codebase
- Keep consistency with existing similar features

## Technical Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript types properly (avoid `any` unless necessary)
- Leverage type inference where appropriate
- Handle async operations with proper error handling
- Use modern ES6+ syntax consistently

### React/Next.js
- Follow React best practices (hooks, composition, etc.)
- Optimize for performance (memoization, lazy loading when needed)
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Maintain proper component hierarchy
- Handle loading and error states

### Database Operations
- Use transactions for multi-step database operations
- Handle database errors gracefully
- Consider data migration needs
- Validate data before database operations
- Use proper indexing for queries

### API Routes
- Validate all inputs at the beginning
- Return consistent error formats
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Add appropriate logging
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios

### State Management
- Use Zustand stores following existing patterns
- Keep state minimal and derived data computed
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Consider state persistence needs

## Quality Checklist

Before considering the task complete:

- [ ] All requirements from the specification are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and patterns
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is well-documented where needed
- [ ] UI is responsive and accessible (if applicable)
- [ ] Database operations are safe and efficient (if applicable)

## Don't Overlook

- **Error states**: How does the feature handle failures?
- **Loading states**: What does the user see while waiting?
- **Empty states**: What if there's no data?
- **Edge cases**: What about unusual inputs or scenarios?
- **Performance**: Will this scale with more data?
- **Accessibility**: Can keyboard users navigate this?
- **Mobile**: Does this work on smaller screens?

## Integration Points

When your code interacts with other parts of the system:

- Understand the existing data flow
- Respect existing interfaces and contracts
- Add proper error boundaries
- Consider backward compatibility
- Document integration points
- Test the integration thoroughly

Remember: The goal is to add value to the project while maintaining its quality and consistency.
