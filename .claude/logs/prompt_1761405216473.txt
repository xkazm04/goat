# refactor-match-grid-feature-structure

## Description

Refactor the Match Grid system from ~20 monolithic files into a modular feature architecture with clear separation between container components, presentational components, and domain-specific utilities. This improves maintainability, reduces coupling, and enables parallel development. Follow the existing feature-based structure pattern by organizing components into feature subdirectories (MatchGrid, MatchPodium, MatchBacklog, MatchControls) with dedicated lib folders for domain logic.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create new feature subdirectories under `app/features/Match/`: MatchGrid/, MatchPodium/, MatchBacklog/, MatchControls/, MatchState/ to organize related components and utilities by domain
2. Move MatchGridPodium.tsx and related podium-specific components to `app/features/Match/MatchPodium/` and create MatchPodium/index.tsx as the public export point
3. Move MatchGridItemEmpty.tsx, MatchGridItemControls.tsx, and MatchGridSlot.tsx to `app/features/Match/MatchControls/` with a shared MatchControls/index.tsx
4. Create `app/features/Match/MatchGrid/lib/` folder and extract drag-and-drop logic, grid state management helpers, and sizing utilities from MatchContainer.tsx into dedicated files (dragHandlers.ts, gridCalculations.ts, sizeMapping.ts)
5. Create `app/features/Match/MatchState/` to centralize store-related logic: create useMatchGridState.ts hook that aggregates useItemStore, useMatchStore, useListStore selectors with memoization
6. Update MatchContainer.tsx to use the new feature structure, importing from feature index files rather than individual components, reducing import complexity
7. Update all internal imports across the Match feature to reference the new feature structure (e.g., `from '@/app/features/Match/MatchPodium'` instead of `from '@/app/features/Match/MatchGridPodium'`)
8. Create `app/features/Match/README.md` documenting the new feature structure, component responsibilities, and data flow for future developers

## UI/UX Innovation Experiment

Add an animated visual indicator showing the feature module structure in the header (collapsible tree diagram) that displays which components are currently active/in-use during drag operations, helping developers understand the component hierarchy in real-time.

## Update FILE_STRUCTURE.MD

IMPORTANT: After implementing the changes, update the FILE_STRUCTURE.MD file in the context directory to reflect the latest changes.

Include:
1. New files created or modified
2. Updated component relationships
3. New patterns or architectural decisions

At the end of FILE_STRUCTURE.MD, add a "## Next Steps" section with your recommendation for the next goal or feature to implement based on the current progress.

## Recommended Next Goal

After refactoring, implement shared state synchronization layer between Match Grid and Backlog features to enable bi-directional updates and prepare infrastructure for database persistence in Goal 4.
