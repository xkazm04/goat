# Implementation Log: Blur-up Placeholder for Missing Collection Images

## Metadata
- **Requirement**: idea-f2d9af46-blur-up-placeholder-for-missin
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Status**: Completed
- **Tested**: false

## Title
Blur-up Placeholder Image Component

## Overview
Implemented a reusable PlaceholderImage component that renders a low-resolution blurred placeholder while the high-resolution image loads. The component uses intersection observer for lazy loading and applies a smooth fade transition when the final image loads. Integrated the component into ItemCard (used by CollectionItem and other UI) and DragOverlayContent for consistent image handling across the application.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
- `src/components/ui/placeholder-image.tsx` - The new PlaceholderImage component

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/item-card.tsx` - Updated to use PlaceholderImage for both grid and list layouts
- `src/app/features/Match/sub_MatchGrid/components/DragComponents.tsx` - Updated DragOverlayContent to use PlaceholderImage

## Key Features
- Blur-up effect with configurable blur amount (default 20px)
- Intersection observer for lazy loading with configurable threshold and root margin
- Smooth fade transition when high-res image loads (0.5s duration)
- Default SVG placeholder when no placeholder URL provided
- Consistent seed-based placeholder selection for visual variety
- Fallback component support for custom "no image" UI
- Full accessibility with proper aria attributes
- Test IDs for automated testing

## Overview Bullets
- Created PlaceholderImage component with blur-up effect and intersection observer
- Updated ItemCard to use PlaceholderImage for missing images in grid/list layouts
- Updated DragOverlayContent to show blur-up placeholder during drag operations
- Added default SVG placeholders with gradient backgrounds
- Implemented smooth fade transition when high-res images load
