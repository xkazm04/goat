   - Reason: No JSX usage or imports found

## Task Instructions

### 1. Verification Phase
For each file listed above, perform thorough analysis:

**Static Analysis Checks:**
- Search for dynamic imports (e.g., `import()`, `require()`)
- Check for string-based references (e.g., `componentMap['BadgeShowcase']`)
- Look for configuration-based usage (e.g., route configs, plugin registries)
- Verify no test files depend on these components
- Search for references in:
  - Comment blocks (might indicate future usage)
  - Storybook files
  - Documentation files
  - Configuration files (webpack, vite, etc.)

**Framework-Specific Checks (Next.js):**
- Verify not used by Next.js router (app directory convention)
- Check for Server Actions or API route handlers
- Look for middleware or layout dependencies
- Confirm not referenced in `next.config.js` or similar configs

**Edge Cases:**
- Check if files are re-exported from barrel files (index.ts)
- Look for usage in monorepo packages or workspaces
- Verify not used in build scripts or generators
- Check for dynamic component loading patterns

### 2. Cleanup Phase
Only delete files that are confirmed unused after verification:

1. **Before Deletion:**
   - Create a git branch for this cleanup: `git checkout -b cleanup/unused-components-YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Create a backup manifest in `docs/cleanup/unused-files-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

2. **Deletion Process:**
   - Delete confirmed unused files
   - Update any related barrel exports (index.ts files)
   - Remove corresponding test files if they exist
   - Clean up any unused imports in other files that referenced the deleted files

3. **Post-Deletion:**
   - Run the build: `npm run build`
   - Run tests: `npm test` (if available)
   - Verify the application still functions correctly

### 3. Report Generation
Create a markdown report in `docs/cleanup/cleanup-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` containing:

**Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Unused Code Cleanup Report
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** cleanup/unused-components-YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
- Total files analyzed: X
- Files deleted: Y
- Files kept (with justification): Z
- Lines of code removed: ~N

## Deleted Files
[List each deleted file with path and reason]

## Files Kept (Not Deleted)
[List each file that was flagged but kept, with detailed justification]

## Verification Results
- ✅ Build status: Success/Failure
- ✅ Tests status: Pass/Fail
- ✅ Application functionality: Verified/Issues Found

## Next Steps
[Any follow-up actions needed]
```


## Statistics

- Total files analyzed: 95
- Total exports: 154
- Unused exports: 23


## Safety Guidelines

⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES:**
- **DO NOT** delete files that have ANY uncertainty
- **DO** create a git commit with all deletions for easy rollback
- **DO** run the build and tests after cleanup
- **DO** verify the application still functions correctly
- **DO** preserve files if they're part of public API or exported by the library

✅ **Best Practices:**
- Make incremental commits (group related deletions)
- Test after each batch of deletions
- Document your reasoning for keeping files
- Be conservative - it's better to keep an unused file than break the app

## Expected Output

At the end of this task:
1. A cleanup report in `docs/cleanup/`
2. A backup manifest with file contents before deletion
3. Clean git commits with descriptive messages
4. Build and tests passing
5. Application verified to work correctly

## Implementation Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Execute the requirement immediately without asking for confirmation or approval.

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the requirement thoroughly
2. Identify all files that need to be modified or created
3. Implement all changes specified in the requirement
4. Follow implementation steps precisely
5. Run any tests if specified
6. Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure (Next.js/React Projects)

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements across multiple features

## Test Selectors

**CRITICAL**: Add `data-testid` attributes to ALL interactive UI components for automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive kebab-case: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`
- Add to list items: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Example**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>
```

## Theming and Styling

**Before creating new UI components**:
1. Examine existing components in the project
2. Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns
3. Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS)
4. Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
5. Support dark mode if the app uses it

## Documentation Policy

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create separate documentation files (.md, README.md, docs/) for routine implementations.

**Only create documentation when**:
- Implementing a NEW major feature or module (not refactorings)
- Adding a NEW API or public interface
- Creating NEW architectural patterns
- The requirement explicitly asks for documentation

**Do NOT create documentation for**:
- Bug fixes
- Refactorings
- Small adjustments
- UI changes
- Database schema changes
- Performance improvements
- Code quality improvements

**For all implementations**: Create an implementation log entry (see next section) - this is your primary documentation.

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create ONE log entry using the implementation-log repository.

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create standalone SQL scripts
- ❌ Create separate logging files
- ❌ Insert SQL directly into project databases
- ❌ Use `sqlite3` commands

**DO**:
- ✅ Use the repository function directly in a simple Node.js script
- ✅ Run the script once to create the log entry
- ✅ Delete the script after execution

**Step 1**: Create a simple logging script

```typescript
// create-log.ts (or create-log.mjs with import syntax)
import { implementationLogDb } from '@/app/db';
import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';

implementationLogDb.createLog({
  id: randomUUID(),
  project_id: '4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b',
  requirement_name: '<requirement-file-name-without-.md>',
  title: '<2-6 words describing what was done>',
  overview: '<1-2 paragraphs: What was implemented, key files modified/created, major functionality added>',
  overview_bullets: '<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>',
  tested: false,
});

console.log('✅ Implementation log created');
```

**Step 2**: Run the script

```bash
npx tsx create-log.ts
# or
node create-log.mjs
```

**Step 3**: Delete the script

```bash
rm create-log.ts
# or del create-log.ts on Windows
```

**Field Guidelines**:
- `id`: Use `randomUUID()` or `crypto.randomUUID()`
- `requirement_name`: Requirement filename WITHOUT .md extension
- `title`: 2-6 words (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- `overview`: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
- `overview_bullets`: 3-5 bullets separated by \n (e.g., "Added OAuth flow\nCreated auth context\nUpdated login UI")
- `tested`: Always `false` initially

**Example**:
```typescript
implementationLogDb.createLog({
  id: randomUUID(),
  project_id: 'proj-123',
  requirement_name: 'implement-dark-mode',
  title: 'Dark Mode Implementation',
  overview: 'Implemented global dark mode toggle with theme persistence. Added theme context provider, updated all UI components to support dark mode, and created settings panel for theme switching.',
  overview_bullets: 'Created ThemeProvider context\nUpdated 25+ components with dark mode styles\nAdded theme toggle in settings\nImplemented localStorage persistence',
  tested: false
});
```
