You are an expert software engineer. Execute the following requirement immediately. Do not ask questions, do not wait for confirmation. Read the requirement carefully and implement all changes to the codebase as specified.

REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# HydrationSafe higher-order component

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Low (1/3)
- **Impact**: Medium (2/3)
- **Scan Type**: insight_synth
- **Generated**: 10/28/2025, 3:28:53 PM
- **Accepted via**: Tinder UI

## Description
Introduce a HydrationSafe HOC that renders a wrapped component only after mounting, automatically handling the `useHydrationSafe` check. Replace the manual `mounted` guard in ThemeToggle (and future components) with this HOC.

## Reasoning
This pattern removes boilerplate from each component, reduces hydration-mismatch bugs, and encourages consistent usage across the codebase.

## Implementation Guidelines

Please implement this feature following these guidelines:

1. **Code Quality**: Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
2. **Testing**: Add appropriate tests if applicable
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and edge cases
5. **User Experience**: Consider the user experience and accessibility

## Acceptance Criteria

The implementation should:
- Fulfill the description and reasoning outlined above
- Maintain or improve code quality
- Be well-tested and documented
- Follow project conventions and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea via the Tinder UI.
Original idea ID: aae9f2bc-9dfc-4872-b6f6-eea7f0d7a9a2


IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the requirement thoroughly
- Identify all files that need to be modified or created
- Implement all changes specified in the requirement
- Follow the implementation steps precisely
- Create/modify files as needed
- Run any tests if specified
- Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## Context Reference Updates

After implementing changes, if the requirement references a specific CONTEXT (feature group), update the context documentation:

1. Look for `.context` files in the project that match the feature being implemented
2. Update the context file with:
   - New files created
   - Modified components
   - Updated functionality
   - New patterns introduced

Example: If working on "authentication" feature, update `contexts/authentication/.context` with the changes.

## File Structure Guidelines (Next.js/React Projects)

When creating new files in Next.js/React projects, follow this structure:

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI sections
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, and logical helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file for the feature

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements used across multiple features

**Theming and Styling**:
- Before creating new UI components, examine existing components in the project
- Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns of existing components
- Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
- Pay attention to dark mode support if the app uses it

Examples:
- Feature component: `app/features/tasks/components/TaskCard.tsx`
- Feature helper: `app/features/tasks/lib/taskValidation.ts`
- Reusable UI: `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create a log entry in the SQLite database to track what was implemented.

Database Path: `C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db`
Table: `implementation_log`
Project ID: `4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b`

Execute this SQL command after implementation (replace placeholders with actual values):

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '<generate-unique-uuid>',
  '4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b',
  '<requirement-name>',
  '<short-descriptive-title>',
  '<detailed-overview-of-changes>',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**Log Entry Guidelines**:
- `id`: Generate a unique UUID (e.g., using `crypto.randomUUID()` or similar)
- `project_id`: The project identifier (use: "4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b")
- `requirement_name`: Name of the requirement file being executed
- `title`: Short, descriptive title (2-6 words, e.g., "Add User Authentication")
- `overview`: Detailed paragraph describing:
  - What was implemented
  - Key files created or modified
  - Major functionality added
  - Any important patterns or decisions made
- `tested`: Always set to 0 (false) initially
- `created_at`: Use `datetime('now')` for current timestamp

**Example Log Entry**:

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
  'project-abc-123',
  'implement-user-login',
  'User Login System',
  'Implemented complete user authentication system with login form, JWT token management, and session persistence. Created LoginForm.tsx component, authService.ts for API calls, and useAuth hook for state management. Added protected route wrapper and login/logout functionality. Integrated with existing theme using glassmorphism design.',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**How to Execute the SQL**:
Use the sqlite3 command-line tool or Node.js better-sqlite3 library:

```bash
sqlite3 "C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db" "INSERT INTO implementation_log (...) VALUES (...);"
```

Or in Node.js/TypeScript:
```typescript
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database('C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db');
db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO implementation_log (id, project_id, requirement_name, title, overview, tested, created_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))
`).run(id, projectId, requirementName, title, overview, 0);
db.close();
```
