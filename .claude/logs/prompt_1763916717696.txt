## Task Instructions

### Phase 1: Deep Component Analysis

For each unused component, analyze:

**1. Component Purpose & Functionality**
- Read the component code thoroughly
- Identify its primary purpose and capabilities
- Document its props interface and API
- Note any dependencies or integration requirements
- Assess code quality and maintainability

**2. Current Codebase Gaps**
- Search for similar functionality already implemented
- Identify areas where this component could add value
- Look for incomplete features that could use this component
- Find redundant implementations that could be replaced

**3. Integration Opportunities**
- Determine specific pages/features that could use this component
- Identify refactoring opportunities (replacing existing code)
- Assess potential for reusability across the app
- Consider whether component needs updates before integration

**4. Technical Feasibility**
- Check for breaking changes needed to integrate
- Verify compatibility with current tech stack
- Identify dependencies that need to be installed
- Assess impact on bundle size and performance

### Phase 2: Create Integration Requirements

For each component that has integration potential, create a separate Claude Code requirement file:

**Requirement File Naming:**
`requirements/integrate-[component-name].md`

**Requirement Template:**
```markdown
# Integrate [Component Name] into [Feature/Page]

## Component Overview
**File:** `[relative path]`
**Exports:** [list exports]
**Purpose:** [Brief description]

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the requirement thoroughly
- Identify all files that need to be modified or created
- Implement all changes specified in the requirement
- Follow the implementation steps precisely
- Create/modify files as needed
- Run any tests if specified
- Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure Guidelines (Next.js/React Projects)

When creating new files in Next.js/React projects, follow this structure:

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI sections
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, and logical helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file for the feature

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements used across multiple features

**Theming and Styling**:
- Before creating new UI components, examine existing components in the project
- Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns of existing components
- Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
- Pay attention to dark mode support if the app uses it

Examples:
- Feature component: `app/features/tasks/components/TaskCard.tsx`
- Feature helper: `app/features/tasks/lib/taskValidation.ts`
- Reusable UI: `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`

## Test Coverage Preparation

**IMPORTANT**: For all interactive UI components (buttons, inputs, forms, modals, etc.), add `data-testid` attributes to enable automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add `data-testid` to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive, kebab-case naming: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context in the ID: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`, `data-testid="password-input"`
- Add to list items for testing selection: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Examples**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>

<div className="modal" data-testid="delete-confirmation-modal">
  ...
</div>
```

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create a log entry using the implementation-log repository to track what was implemented.

Project ID: `4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b`


**Use the Implementation Log Repository** (located at `src/app/db/repositories/implementation-log.repository.ts`):

```typescript
import { implementationLogRepository } from '@/app/db/repositories/implementation-log.repository';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

// Create log entry
implementationLogRepository.createLog({
  id: uuidv4(),
  project_id: '4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b',
  requirement_name: '<requirement-name>',
  title: '<short-descriptive-title>',
  overview: '<detailed-overview-of-changes>',
  overview_bullets: '<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>\n<bullet4>',
  tested: false
});
```

**Log Entry Guidelines**:
- `id`: Generate a unique UUID using `uuidv4()` or `crypto.randomUUID()`
- `project_id`: The project identifier (use: "4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b")
- `requirement_name`: Name of the requirement file being executed (without .md extension)
- `title`: Short, descriptive title (2-6 words, e.g., "Add User Authentication")
- `overview`: Detailed paragraph describing:
  - What was implemented
  - Key files created or modified
  - Major functionality added
  - Any important patterns or decisions made
- `overview_bullets`: **REQUIRED** - Newline-separated bullet points (3-5 bullet points) summarizing key changes. Format as plain text with each bullet on a new line:
  - First bullet point describing main change
  - Second bullet point describing another key change
  - Third bullet point describing implementation detail
  - (Optional) Fourth bullet point for additional context
  Example: "Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow\nAdded session management with refresh tokens\nCreated unified auth context provider\nMigrated from cookies to secure HTTP-only tokens"
- `tested`: Always set to false initially

**Example Log Entry**:

```typescript
import { implementationLogRepository } from '@/app/db/repositories/implementation-log.repository';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

implementationLogRepository.createLog({
  id: uuidv4(),
  project_id: 'project-abc-123',
  requirement_name: 'implement-user-login',
  title: 'User Login System',
  overview: 'Implemented complete user authentication system with login form, JWT token management, and session persistence. Created LoginForm.tsx component, authService.ts for API calls, and useAuth hook for state management. Added protected route wrapper and login/logout functionality. Integrated with existing theme using glassmorphism design.',
  overview_bullets: 'Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow
Added session management with refresh tokens
Created unified auth context provider
Integrated with existing glassmorphism theme',
  tested: false
});
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT create standalone script files for logging. Use the repository directly in your implementation or create a simple inline script that imports and uses the repository
