You are an expert software engineer. Execute the following requirement immediately. Do not ask questions, do not wait for confirmation. Read the requirement carefully and implement all changes to the codebase as specified.

REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# refactor-theme-toggle-with-hydration-hook

## Description

Refactor `theme-toggle.tsx` to use the new `useHydrationSafe` hook instead of its current inline `useEffect` + `mounted` state pattern. This consolidates the hydration safety implementation and reduces code duplication while maintaining identical behavior for theme switching functionality.

## Implementation Steps

1. Import `useHydrationSafe` hook at the top of theme-toggle.tsx
2. Replace the existing `const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)` and `useEffect` block with `const mounted = useHydrationSafe()`
3. Verify the conditional rendering logic `{mounted && ...}` still functions correctly
4. Test theme toggle functionality in development mode to ensure no hydration warnings appear
5. Confirm theme persistence and switching works as expected across page navigation

## Files to Modify

- src/components/theme-toggle.tsx
- src/lib/hooks/useHydrationSafe.ts

## Recommended Next Goal

Refactor ClientOnly.tsx to use useHydrationSafe hook for consistency
