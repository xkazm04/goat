You are an expert software engineer. Execute the following requirement immediately. Do not ask questions, do not wait for confirmation. Read the requirement carefully and implement all changes to the codebase as specified.

REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# migrate-client-hooks-and-update-env-config

## Description

Move all client-side API hooks from their current locations to src/hooks/ directory and update .env.example with Supabase configuration variables. This consolidates hook management in a single location and provides clear documentation for developers setting up the project. Create custom hooks for common Supabase operations (useQuery, useMutation, useAuth) that wrap Supabase operations with React patterns.

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify all existing custom hooks that consume the API (typically files with 'use' prefix in src/lib/ or component directories) and document their current locations
2. Create src/hooks/useSupabaseQuery.ts hook that wraps Supabase queries with loading, error, and data states, following React Query patterns for consistency with existing codebase
3. Create src/hooks/useSupabaseMutation.ts hook for mutations (insert, update, delete) with optimistic updates and error handling
4. Create src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.ts hook to manage authentication state using Supabase's built-in auth methods
5. Move all existing API consumption hooks to src/hooks/ with updated imports to use the new Supabase adapter from src/api/supabase-adapter.ts
6. Update .env.example with all required Supabase variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (for server-side operations), and legacy API_URL (marked as deprecated)
7. Add migration guide comment in .env.example explaining the transition from HTTP API to Supabase

## Files to Modify

- src/hooks/useSupabaseQuery.ts
- src/hooks/useSupabaseMutation.ts
- src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.ts
- .env.example
- src/hooks/index.ts

## Update FILE_STRUCTURE.MD

IMPORTANT: After implementing the changes, update the FILE_STRUCTURE.MD file in the context directory to reflect the latest changes.

Include:
1. New files created or modified
2. Updated component relationships
3. New patterns or architectural decisions

At the end of FILE_STRUCTURE.MD, add a "## Next Steps" section with your recommendation for the next goal or feature to implement based on the current progress.

## Recommended Next Goal

Update all React components that currently use the old API client to consume the new hooks from src/hooks/, testing each feature module to ensure data flows correctly from Supabase
