## Task Instructions

### 1. Verification Phase
For each file listed above, perform thorough analysis:

**Static Analysis Checks:**
- Search for dynamic imports (e.g., `import()`, `require()`)
- Check for string-based references (e.g., `componentMap['Dialog']`)
- Look for configuration-based usage (e.g., route configs, plugin registries)
- Verify no test files depend on these components
- Search for references in:
  - Comment blocks (might indicate future usage)
  - Storybook files
  - Documentation files
  - Configuration files (webpack, vite, etc.)

**Framework-Specific Checks (Next.js):**
- Verify not used by Next.js router (app directory convention)
- Check for Server Actions or API route handlers
- Look for middleware or layout dependencies
- Confirm not referenced in `next.config.js` or similar configs

**Edge Cases:**
- Check if files are re-exported from barrel files (index.ts)
- Look for usage in monorepo packages or workspaces
- Verify not used in build scripts or generators
- Check for dynamic component loading patterns

### 2. Cleanup Phase
Only delete files that are confirmed unused after verification:

1. **Before Deletion:**
   - Create a git branch for this cleanup: `git checkout -b cleanup/unused-components-YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Create a backup manifest in `docs/cleanup/unused-files-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

2. **Deletion Process:**
   - Delete confirmed unused files
   - Update any related barrel exports (index.ts files)
   - Remove corresponding test files if they exist
   - Clean up any unused imports in other files that referenced the deleted files

3. **Post-Deletion:**
   - Run the build: `npm run build`
   - Run tests: `npm test` (if available)
   - Verify the application still functions correctly

### 3. Report Generation
Create a markdown report in `docs/cleanup/cleanup-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` containing:

**Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Unused Code Cleanup Report
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** cleanup/unused-components-YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
- Total files analyzed: X
- Files deleted: Y
- Files kept (with justification): Z
- Lines of code removed: ~N

## Deleted Files
[List each deleted file with path and reason]

## Files Kept (Not Deleted)
[List each file that was flagged but kept, with detailed justification]

## Verification Results
- ✅ Build status: Success/Failure
- ✅ Tests status: Pass/Fail
- ✅ Application functionality: Verified/Issues Found

## Next Steps
[Any follow-up actions needed]
```


## Statistics

- Total files analyzed: 92
- Total exports: 186
- Unused exports: 52


## Safety Guidelines

⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES:**
- **DO NOT** delete files that have ANY uncertainty
- **DO** create a git commit with all deletions for easy rollback
- **DO** run the build and tests after cleanup
- **DO** verify the application still functions correctly
- **DO** preserve files if they're part of public API or exported by the library

✅ **Best Practices:**
- Make incremental commits (group related deletions)
- Test after each batch of deletions
- Document your reasoning for keeping files
- Be conservative - it's better to keep an unused file than break the app

## Expected Output

At the end of this task:
1. A cleanup report in `docs/cleanup/`
2. A backup manifest with file contents before deletion
3. Clean git commits with descriptive messages
4. Build and tests passing
5. Application verified to work correctly

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the requirement thoroughly
- Identify all files that need to be modified or created
- Implement all changes specified in the requirement
- Follow the implementation steps precisely
- Create/modify files as needed
- Run any tests if specified
- Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure Guidelines (Next.js/React Projects)

When creating new files in Next.js/React projects, follow this structure:

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI sections
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, and logical helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file for the feature

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements used across multiple features

**Theming and Styling**:
- Before creating new UI components, examine existing components in the project
- Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns of existing components
- Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
- Pay attention to dark mode support if the app uses it

Examples:
- Feature component: `app/features/tasks/components/TaskCard.tsx`
- Feature helper: `app/features/tasks/lib/taskValidation.ts`
- Reusable UI: `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`

## Test Coverage Preparation

**IMPORTANT**: For all interactive UI components (buttons, inputs, forms, modals, etc.), add `data-testid` attributes to enable automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add `data-testid` to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive, kebab-case naming: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context in the ID: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`, `data-testid="password-input"`
- Add to list items for testing selection: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Examples**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>

<div className="modal" data-testid="delete-confirmation-modal">
  ...
</div>
```

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create a log entry using the implementation-log repository to track what was implemented.

Project ID: `4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b`


**Use the Implementation Log Repository** (located at `src/app/db/repositories/implementation-log.repository.ts`):

```typescript
import { implementationLogRepository } from '@/app/db/repositories/implementation-log.repository';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

// Create log entry
implementationLogRepository.createLog({
  id: uuidv4(),
  project_id: '4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b',
  requirement_name: '<requirement-name>',
  title: '<short-descriptive-title>',
  overview: '<detailed-overview-of-changes>',
  overview_bullets: '<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>\n<bullet4>',
  tested: false
});
```

**Log Entry Guidelines**:
- `id`: Generate a unique UUID using `uuidv4()` or `crypto.randomUUID()`
- `project_id`: The project identifier (use: "4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b")
- `requirement_name`: Name of the requirement file being executed (without .md extension)
- `title`: Short, descriptive title (2-6 words, e.g., "Add User Authentication")
- `overview`: Detailed paragraph describing:
  - What was implemented
  - Key files created or modified
  - Major functionality added
  - Any important patterns or decisions made
- `overview_bullets`: **REQUIRED** - Newline-separated bullet points (3-5 bullet points) summarizing key changes. Format as plain text with each bullet on a new line:
  - First bullet point describing main change
  - Second bullet point describing another key change
  - Third bullet point describing implementation detail
  - (Optional) Fourth bullet point for additional context
  Example: "Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow\nAdded session management with refresh tokens\nCreated unified auth context provider\nMigrated from cookies to secure HTTP-only tokens"
- `tested`: Always set to false initially

**Example Log Entry**:

```typescript
import { implementationLogRepository } from '@/app/db/repositories/implementation-log.repository';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

implementationLogRepository.createLog({
  id: uuidv4(),
  project_id: 'project-abc-123',
  requirement_name: 'implement-user-login',
  title: 'User Login System',
  overview: 'Implemented complete user authentication system with login form, JWT token management, and session persistence. Created LoginForm.tsx component, authService.ts for API calls, and useAuth hook for state management. Added protected route wrapper and login/logout functionality. Integrated with existing theme using glassmorphism design.',
  overview_bullets: 'Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow
Added session management with refresh tokens
Created unified auth context provider
Integrated with existing glassmorphism theme',
  tested: false
});
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT create standalone script files for logging. Use the repository directly in your implementation or create a simple inline script that imports and uses the repository
