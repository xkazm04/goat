You are an expert software engineer. Execute the following requirement immediately. Do not ask questions, do not wait for confirmation. Read the requirement carefully and implement all changes to the codebase as specified.

REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# refactor-match-page-state-machine-integration

## Description

Integrate the new loading state machine throughout match/page.tsx by refactoring all data fetching logic (list loading, backlog loading, item fetching) to use the unified state machine and remove all old boolean state variables. Ensure all API calls from src/lib/api/item-groups.ts are properly sequenced through state transitions and that the UI correctly reflects the current state.

## Implementation Steps

1. In src/app/match/page.tsx, identify all useEffect hooks that manage listLoading, fetchLoading, isBacklogLoading and consolidate them into a single orchestrating effect that dispatches state machine actions
2. Replace all direct API calls with dispatch actions: when calling itemGroupsApi.list(), dispatch START_LIST_LOAD, on success dispatch SET_SUCCESS, on error dispatch SET_ERROR with categorized error
3. Refactor the data fetching sequence: ensure list loads first (START_LIST_LOAD), then fetch (START_FETCH_LOAD), then backlog (START_BACKLOG_LOAD), using the state machine to enforce this order
4. Remove all useState declarations for listLoading, fetchLoading, isBacklogLoading - replace with single useReducer for loading state machine
5. Update all conditional rendering: replace {listLoading && <Skeleton />} with {state.state === 'LOADING_LIST' && <Skeleton />}, or use isLoadingState(state.state) helper for multi-state checks
6. Add a debug mode (optional console output) that logs all state transitions for development: 'IDLE → LOADING_LIST → LOADING_FETCH → SUCCESS'
7. Test the complete flow: verify state transitions match expected sequence, error states are properly caught and displayed, and UI updates correctly at each stage

## Files to Modify

- src/app/match/page.tsx
- src/lib/hooks/useLoadingStateMachine.ts

## UI/UX Innovation Experiment

Add a subtle state transition timeline visualization in the page header that shows the current loading phase with animated step indicators (e.g., 'Loading items → Fetching details → Loading backlog → Ready'), with each step highlighting as it completes, providing clear visual feedback of progress through the loading sequence

## Recommended Next Goal

Create a shared loading state machine pattern documentation/example so other pages in the app can adopt the same pattern, potentially extracting it into a reusable context provider for app-wide state machine management



IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the requirement thoroughly
- Identify all files that need to be modified or created
- Implement all changes specified in the requirement
- Follow the implementation steps precisely
- Create/modify files as needed
- Run any tests if specified
- Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## Context Reference Updates

After implementing changes, if the requirement references a specific CONTEXT (feature group), update the context documentation:

1. Look for `.context` files in the project that match the feature being implemented
2. Update the context file with:
   - New files created
   - Modified components
   - Updated functionality
   - New patterns introduced

Example: If working on "authentication" feature, update `contexts/authentication/.context` with the changes.

## File Structure Guidelines (Next.js/React Projects)

When creating new files in Next.js/React projects, follow this structure:

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI sections
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, and logical helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file for the feature

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements used across multiple features

**Theming and Styling**:
- Before creating new UI components, examine existing components in the project
- Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns of existing components
- Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
- Pay attention to dark mode support if the app uses it

Examples:
- Feature component: `app/features/tasks/components/TaskCard.tsx`
- Feature helper: `app/features/tasks/lib/taskValidation.ts`
- Reusable UI: `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create a log entry in the SQLite database to track what was implemented.

Database Path: `C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db`
Table: `implementation_log`
Project ID: `4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b`

Execute this SQL command after implementation (replace placeholders with actual values):

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '<generate-unique-uuid>',
  '4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b',
  '<requirement-name>',
  '<short-descriptive-title>',
  '<detailed-overview-of-changes>',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**Log Entry Guidelines**:
- `id`: Generate a unique UUID (e.g., using `crypto.randomUUID()` or similar)
- `project_id`: The project identifier (use: "4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b")
- `requirement_name`: Name of the requirement file being executed
- `title`: Short, descriptive title (2-6 words, e.g., "Add User Authentication")
- `overview`: Detailed paragraph describing:
  - What was implemented
  - Key files created or modified
  - Major functionality added
  - Any important patterns or decisions made
- `tested`: Always set to 0 (false) initially
- `created_at`: Use `datetime('now')` for current timestamp

**Example Log Entry**:

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
  'project-abc-123',
  'implement-user-login',
  'User Login System',
  'Implemented complete user authentication system with login form, JWT token management, and session persistence. Created LoginForm.tsx component, authService.ts for API calls, and useAuth hook for state management. Added protected route wrapper and login/logout functionality. Integrated with existing theme using glassmorphism design.',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**How to Execute the SQL**:
Use the sqlite3 command-line tool or Node.js better-sqlite3 library:

```bash
sqlite3 "C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db" "INSERT INTO implementation_log (...) VALUES (...);"
```

Or in Node.js/TypeScript:
```typescript
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database('C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db');
db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO implementation_log (id, project_id, requirement_name, title, overview, tested, created_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))
`).run(id, projectId, requirementName, title, overview, 0);
db.close();
```
