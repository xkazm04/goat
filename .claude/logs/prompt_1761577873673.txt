You are an expert software engineer. Execute the following requirement immediately. Do not ask questions, do not wait for confirmation. Read the requirement carefully and implement all changes to the codebase as specified.

REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# migrate-client-hooks-and-update-env-config

## Description

Move all client-side API hooks from their current locations to src/hooks/ directory and update .env.example with Supabase configuration variables. This consolidates hook management in a single location and provides clear documentation for developers setting up the project. Create custom hooks for common Supabase operations (useQuery, useMutation, useAuth) that wrap Supabase operations with React patterns.

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify all existing custom hooks that consume the API (typically files with 'use' prefix in src/lib/ or component directories) and document their current locations
2. Create src/hooks/useSupabaseQuery.ts hook that wraps Supabase queries with loading, error, and data states, following React Query patterns for consistency with existing codebase
3. Create src/hooks/useSupabaseMutation.ts hook for mutations (insert, update, delete) with optimistic updates and error handling
4. Create src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.ts hook to manage authentication state using Supabase's built-in auth methods
5. Move all existing API consumption hooks to src/hooks/ with updated imports to use the new Supabase adapter from src/api/supabase-adapter.ts
6. Update .env.example with all required Supabase variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (for server-side operations), and legacy API_URL (marked as deprecated)
7. Add migration guide comment in .env.example explaining the transition from HTTP API to Supabase

## Files to Modify

- src/hooks/useSupabaseQuery.ts
- src/hooks/useSupabaseMutation.ts
- src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.ts
- .env.example
- src/hooks/index.ts

## Update FILE_STRUCTURE.MD

IMPORTANT: After implementing the changes, update the FILE_STRUCTURE.MD file in the context directory to reflect the latest changes.

Include:
1. New files created or modified
2. Updated component relationships
3. New patterns or architectural decisions

At the end of FILE_STRUCTURE.MD, add a "## Next Steps" section with your recommendation for the next goal or feature to implement based on the current progress.

## Recommended Next Goal

Update all React components that currently use the old API client to consume the new hooks from src/hooks/, testing each feature module to ensure data flows correctly from Supabase



IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the requirement thoroughly
- Identify all files that need to be modified or created
- Implement all changes specified in the requirement
- Follow the implementation steps precisely
- Create/modify files as needed
- Run any tests if specified
- Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## Context Reference Updates

After implementing changes, if the requirement references a specific CONTEXT (feature group), update the context documentation:

1. Look for `.context` files in the project that match the feature being implemented
2. Update the context file with:
   - New files created
   - Modified components
   - Updated functionality
   - New patterns introduced

Example: If working on "authentication" feature, update `contexts/authentication/.context` with the changes.

## File Structure Guidelines (Next.js/React Projects)

When creating new files in Next.js/React projects, follow this structure:

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI sections
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, and logical helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file for the feature

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements used across multiple features

**Theming and Styling**:
- Before creating new UI components, examine existing components in the project
- Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns of existing components
- Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
- Pay attention to dark mode support if the app uses it

Examples:
- Feature component: `app/features/tasks/components/TaskCard.tsx`
- Feature helper: `app/features/tasks/lib/taskValidation.ts`
- Reusable UI: `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create a log entry in the SQLite database to track what was implemented.

Database Path: `C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db`
Table: `implementation_log`
Project ID: `4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b`

Execute this SQL command after implementation (replace placeholders with actual values):

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '<generate-unique-uuid>',
  '4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b',
  '<requirement-name>',
  '<short-descriptive-title>',
  '<detailed-overview-of-changes>',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**Log Entry Guidelines**:
- `id`: Generate a unique UUID (e.g., using `crypto.randomUUID()` or similar)
- `project_id`: The project identifier (use: "4ee93a8c-9318-4497-b7cf-05027e48f12b")
- `requirement_name`: Name of the requirement file being executed
- `title`: Short, descriptive title (2-6 words, e.g., "Add User Authentication")
- `overview`: Detailed paragraph describing:
  - What was implemented
  - Key files created or modified
  - Major functionality added
  - Any important patterns or decisions made
- `tested`: Always set to 0 (false) initially
- `created_at`: Use `datetime('now')` for current timestamp

**Example Log Entry**:

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
  'project-abc-123',
  'implement-user-login',
  'User Login System',
  'Implemented complete user authentication system with login form, JWT token management, and session persistence. Created LoginForm.tsx component, authService.ts for API calls, and useAuth hook for state management. Added protected route wrapper and login/logout functionality. Integrated with existing theme using glassmorphism design.',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**How to Execute the SQL**:
Use the sqlite3 command-line tool or Node.js better-sqlite3 library:

```bash
sqlite3 "C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db" "INSERT INTO implementation_log (...) VALUES (...);"
```

Or in Node.js/TypeScript:
```typescript
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database('C:\Users\kazda\kiro\goat\database\goals.db');
db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO implementation_log (id, project_id, requirement_name, title, overview, tested, created_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))
`).run(id, projectId, requirementName, title, overview, 0);
db.close();
```
